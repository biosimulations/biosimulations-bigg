    to reconcile two metabolic reconstructions (MR)</bold>. This figure illustrates
    the automated comparison tool developed for the Salmonella reconstruction jamboree.
    Both MRs are translated into a common language (based on KEGG [<xref ref-type="bibr"
    rid="B44">44</xref>]). Metabolites and reactions that could not be mapped onto
    KEGG were subject to manual evaluation by the jamboree team. The overlapping part
    of the MRs was directly moved into the consensus MR while reactions and metabolites
    unique to a MR were evaluated manually. This approach can be readily applied to
    comparison of any two MRs.</p>

    drug targets</bold>. The figure contains all predicted synthetic lethal interactions
    for STM_v1.0 in LB medium. A line connecting two genes represents a synthetic
    lethal pair. A group of genes surrounded by a dashed box represents a protein
    complex requiring all enclosed elements to function. Yellow background means associated
    with sulfur metabolism. Blue background indicates that the synthetic lethal pairs
    are functional homolog's. Red gene means that there is a chemical known to inhibit
    the gene-product in STM_v1.0.</p>
