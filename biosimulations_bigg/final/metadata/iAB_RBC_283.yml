    Workflow for building a comprehensive <italic>in silico </italic>erythrocyte metabolic
    network</bold>. The three major data types required are: the human genome sequence,
    high-throughput data (specifically, proteomics for an enucleated cell), and primary
    literature. The global human metabolic network, Recon 1, was constructed from
    the human genome sequence and annotation. To build the erythrocyte network, iAB-RBC-283,
    proteomics was used to remove non-erythrocyte related open reading frames (ORFs)
    or genes. Detailed curation utilizing protein, metabolite, and transport experimental
    literature was needed to build a high-quality metabolic reconstruction. (B) Without
    network reconstruction and rigorous curation, the experimentally generated proteomic
    data is raw and difficult to interpret. The process detailed in panel A provides
    a means to build a meaningful knowledge-base of available high-throughput data
    that can then be probed and tested.</p>'

    metabolite connectivity of iAB-RBC-283, Recon 1, and the similarly sized organelles
    in Recon 1</bold>. Recon 1 and the mitochondria have high network connectivity,
    with many data points above the reference lines. The erythrocyte network and other
    organelles have less metabolic connectivity denoted by data point being on or
    below the reference lines. This characteristic can be attributed to either 1)
    an inherently 'fragmented' erythrocyte network, or 2) incomplete proteomic coverage.</p>

    variability of the exchange reactions can be used to detect metabolic signatures
    of simulated morbid SNPs and drug treated erythrocytes</bold>. <bold>(A) </bold>Exchange
    reactions are artificial reactions that allow the mathematical model to uptake
    and secrete metabolites into the extracellular space. Uptake of a metabolite into
    the erythrocyte is expressed as a negative value and secretion is expressed as
    a positive value. There are four major differences that can occur for an exchange
    reaction in two different states: i) the reaction is either active (non-zero minimum
    or maximum flux) or inactive (zero minimum and maximum flux), ii) the exchange
    becomes fixed in one direction (uptake or secretion only), iii) there is a magnitude
    change in exchange, iv) the reaction is unaffected and is the same for both states.
    <bold>(B) </bold>We detected 71% and 62% of the morbid SNPs and drugs associated
    with the erythrocyte. The distribution shows that most perturbed conditions have
    between one to ten differentially active exchange reactions.</p>'
