- caption: <p>Classification of the ORFs, reactions and metabolites included in <italic>i</italic>AF1260.
    (<bold>A</bold>) Coverage of characterized ORFs from each of the COGs functional
    classes included in <italic>i</italic>AF1260 and five previous reconstructions.
    The percentage given is the total coverage accounted for in <italic>i</italic>AF1260
    for each class. Some ORFs included in the reconstructions did not have a COG functional
    class assignment (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplemental
    information</xref>). (<bold>B</bold>) The number of reactions (both gene-associated
    and non-gene associated) that are associated to ORFs from each COG functional
    class. Since ORFs can belong to multiple classes, the percent unique in each class
    is listed. Non-gene-associated reactions were assigned to a class manually. (<bold>C</bold>)
    The number of metabolites that participate in reactions from each functional class
    and the percent unique in each class. Other (OT) includes classes J, K, L, O,
    T, U, V (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary information</xref>).
    NC, no COG assignment.</p>

- caption: <p>Thermodynamic properties of the reactions in <italic>i</italic>AF1260.
    (<bold>A</bold>) The distribution of estimated &#916;<sub><italic>r</italic></sub>G&#8242;<sup>m</sup>
    values for the reactions in <italic>i</italic>AF1260. &#916;<sub><italic>r</italic></sub>G&#8242;<sup>m</sup>
    could be estimated for 1996 reactions (96%) in the reconstruction. 64% of the
    represented reactions have a negative &#916;<sub><italic>r</italic></sub>G&#8242;<sup>m</sup>,
    and 20% of the reactions have a &#916;<sub><italic>r</italic></sub>G&#8242;<sup>m</sup>
    of approximately zero. This distribution of &#916;<sub><italic>r</italic></sub>G&#8242;<sup>m</sup>
    values indicates that most reactions in the model are thermodynamically favorable
    at millimolar concentration conditions. (<bold>B</bold>) The range of possible
    &#916;<sub><italic>r</italic></sub>G&#8242; values for the reactions in <italic>i</italic>AF1260.
    &#916;<sub><italic>r</italic></sub>G&#8242; differs from &#916;<sub><italic>r</italic></sub>G&#8242;<sup>o</sup>
    (orange diamonds) and &#916;<sub><italic>r</italic></sub>G&#8242;<sup>m</sup>
    (black diamonds) due to variations in metabolite concentrations from the 1 M and
    1 mM reference states, respectively. Metabolite concentrations typically range
    from 0.02 to 0.00001 M, resulting in a wide range of values for &#916;<sub><italic>r</italic></sub>G&#8242;
    (blue error bars). Taking uncertainty into account, the range of possible values
    for &#916;<sub><italic>r</italic></sub>G&#8242; can be extended (purple error
    bars). The &#916;<sub><italic>r</italic></sub>G&#8242; ranges were used to assess
    the feasibility and reversibility of the reactions in <italic>i</italic>AF1260;
    reactions for which a positive &#916;<sub><italic>r</italic></sub>G&#8242; is
    not possible are thermodynamically irreversible.</p>

    A drawing of central metabolism and the ETS included in <italic>i</italic>AF1260.
    Originally, the entire network is unconstrained. (<bold>B</bold>) Application
    of transcriptional regulatory effects restricts the total number of pathways,
    or routes, flux can pass through in the network. (<bold>C</bold>) Further application
    of known reaction capacities can result in more accurate predictions. For example,
    the flux through the NADH dehydrogenase enzymes is split in a 1:1 ratio during
    a simulation to produce an optimal P/O ratio of approximately 1.4 (<xref ref-type="bibr"
    rid="b21">Gennis and Stewart, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">Noguchi
    <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>). (<bold>D</bold>) The non-metabolic activity
    of the cell can be accounted for through maintenance parameters and these were
    approximated using experimental data under known media conditions. Chemostat data
    (see Materials and methods) was used (triangles) and the dotted line shows the
    modeling predictions with the appropriate maintenance parameters. (<bold>E</bold>)
    After the parameters are approximated, the model can then be used to predict the
    GR (circles), product formation (acetate, squares) and additional uptake rates
    (oxygen, triangles) under different environmental conditions (for succinate growth
    in this case).</p>

    The relationship between the GUR (mmol gDW<sup>&#8722;1</sup> h<sup>&#8722;1</sup>)
    (bottom axes, the dependant variable) and the resulting (1) GR (h<sup>&#8722;1</sup>)
    (left axes) and (2) OUR (mmol gDW<sup>&#8722;1</sup> h<sup>&#8722;1</sup>) (right
    axes) produced during the sensitivity analysis using <italic>i</italic>AF1260.
    Using FBA and <italic>i</italic>AF1260, optimal growth was simulated under glucose
    aerobic conditions while varying (<bold>A</bold>) the dry weight percentage of
    protein (50&#8211;80%), (<bold>B</bold>) RNA (10&#8211;25%) and (<bold>C</bold>)
    lipid (7&#8211;15%) in the BOF<sub>CORE</sub> using physiologically measured values
    (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">Pramanik and Keasling, 1997</xref>). Also analyzed
    was (<bold>D</bold>) potential P/O ratios (1.0&#8211;2.7) in the network, as well
    as the (<bold>E</bold>) NGAM (&#177;50%) and (<bold>F</bold>) GAM (&#177;50%)
    that were determined for these conditions.</p>

- caption: <p>ORF essentiality predictions using <italic>i</italic>AF1260. This heat
    map characterizes the agreement between ORFs predicted to be essential using <italic>i</italic>AF1260
    and those experimentally determined from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Baba <italic>et
    al</italic> (2006)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Joyce <italic>et
    al</italic> (2006)</xref>. The enlarged region details how each a row corresponds
    to a computationally predicted essential ORF (188 total). The overall agreement
    between <italic>i</italic>AF1260 predictions and those found to be experimentally
    essential (overall, column 1) is shown along with a breakdown for ORFs found to
    be essential under rich media conditions (rich, column 2), under both glucose
    and glycerol minimal media conditions (shared, column 3) and under just glucose
    minimal medium conditions (glucose, column 4). ORFs are further grouped by their
    COG functional class (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref> for abbreviations;
    MU-ORF belongs to multiple COG classes). Dark blue indicates the condition under
    which each ORF was found to be essential. For example, <italic>folP</italic> was
    predicted to be an essential ORF for the biosynthesis of folate in <italic>i</italic>AF1260
    under these conditions, but was not identified as essential by <xref ref-type="bibr"
    rid="b7">Baba <italic>et al</italic> (2006)</xref>. This suggested the possibility
    of an alternative pathway for this step in <italic>E. coli</italic> that has yet
    to be characterized.</p>
