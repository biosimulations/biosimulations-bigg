    The workflow detailing the reconstruction process of the <italic>G. metallireducens</italic>
    metabolic network. The reconstruction process was initiated by comparing the updated
    genome annotation for <italic>G. metallireducens</italic> to the existing reconstruction
    to create a list of discrepancies that was manually reviewed and curated. Content
    that was in agreement with the updated annotation and reconstruction was used
    to generate a draft set of intracellular reactions. Lipid, membrane, murein, and
    LPS content were removed from this list as a periplasm compartment was added to
    the reconstruction. Manual curation <xref rid="pcbi.1003575-Thiele1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>
    was aided by the KEGG <xref rid="pcbi.1003575-Kanehisa1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>,
    ModelSEED <xref rid="pcbi.1003575-Henry1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, and MetaCyc
    <xref rid="pcbi.1003575-Caspi1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> databases. Further,
    numerous publications and literature sources (i.e., the &#8220;bibliome&#8221;)
    were used to refine the network content. The manual review process resulted in
    a draft reconstruction that was used in conjunction with a formulated biomass
    objective function in simulations to validate the content of the reconstruction
    and generate a final version. Some figure images adapted from <xref rid="pcbi.1003575-Nagarajan1"

    pathways included in the iAF987 reconstruction and encoded by genes annotated
    in the updated genome annotation. The two pathways, the reductive citric acid
    (TCA), and the dicarboxylate&#8211;hydroxybutyrate cycles share four reactions
    in the citric acid cycle. CO<sub>2</sub> fixation (and resulting acetyl-coA generated)
    and ATP-driven steps are shown in green and red, respectively. B) A graph of phenotypic
    data that demonstrated the model-predicted growth condition of formate as an electron
    donor and carbon source with Fe(III) as an electron acceptor is a viable growth
    condition. Carbon fixation is occurring under these conditions and the specifics
    of this process can be further elucidated in subsequent &#8220;drill-down&#8221;

    The functional states of the network components during internal electron transfer
    to fumarate are shown in green (facilitated by the <italic>dcuB</italic> strain),
    additional components active during internal transfer to nitrate are shown in
    blue, and additional components during external electron transfer (Fe respiration)
    are shown in brown. Note that the fumarate reductase (FRD2rpp) operates in opposite
    directions depending on whether the electron acceptor is fumarate or nitrate/Fe(III).
    Also note that nitrate reductase (NO3R3pp) is not used when Fe(III) is the electron
    acceptor. Abbreviations are defined in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material"
    rid="pcbi.1003575.s002">Dataset S2</xref>. The process was started with the bottom-up
    reconstruction of the updated metabolic network. At each cycle around the loop,
    optimal performance was calculated as different components of the ETS were isolated,
    compared to experimental data, and then incorporated into the reconstruction.
    Ultimately, the final product is a reconstructed ETS consistent with experimental
    data and an estimate of the cost associated with transferring electrons from the
    internal membrane cytochrome (focytC) to the extracellular electron acceptor Fe(III)
    (fe3).</p>
