    xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Step 1. The Plasmodium falciparum
    reconstruction was built using the genome annotation, lists of biomolecules, the
    literature, and organism-specific databases. The reconstruction was refined through
    iterations of manual curation, hypothesis generation, validation against experimental
    data and incorporation of new knowledge[<xref rid="pcbi.1005895.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].
    Step 2. The reconstruction was converted into a model by specifying inputs, outputs
    and relevant parameters, and by representing the network mathematically. The model
    was validated against omic and physiological data. Step 3(i). Once networks were
    accurately reconstructed and converted into stage-specific <italic>in silico</italic>
    models, using high throughput data, the stage-specific models were then used to
    predict genes critical for growth in different life-cycle stages and to detect
    stage-specific redirection of flux in the parasite&#8217;s central carbon metabolism.
    Step 3(ii). Comparative genomics and manual curation were used to build reconstructions
    for Plasmodium species commonly used in experimental animal models to test how
    predicted drug targets differ from predictions in the human-infecting system.
    Multi-species metabolic models were also used to characterize pan and core metabolic
    capacities of the different species.</p>

    xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><bold>(a)</bold> Correlated reaction
    sets for iAM-Pf480 were used to define stage and model specific pathways, which
    were analyzed and compared across different stages. Modularity indices (see <xref
    ref-type="sec" rid="sec012">methods</xref>) were 0.023, 0.024, 0.026, 0.145, 0.022
    for the T, Schizont, GII, GV, and Ook stages, respectively. In proliferative versus
    non-proliferative stages of malaria, there were changes in the patterns of central
    carbon metabolism, notably the non-oxidative PPP and glycolysis. <bold>(b)</bold>
    The direction of flux in the non-oxidative branch of PPP goes towards production
    of glycolytic intermediates in the Trophozoite, Schizont, GII, and GV stages but
    not the Ookinete stage. Reversal of non-oxidative pentose phosphate pathway fluxes
    in the Ook enables provision of ribose 5 phosphate (r5p) needed for the synthesis
    of nucleotide precursors of DNA. The non-oxidative branch in the schizont is colored
    in red indicating its coupling to growth rate in this stage (Table G in <xref
    ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005895.s002">S1 Tables</xref>). Both
    the oxidative and non-oxidative PPP branches were correlated in GII. Glycolysis
    was split into upper and lower branches in all stages except GV where the non-oxidative
    PPP branch was correlated with inositol metabolism. Arrows are omitted from the
    schizont pathway map to account for reduced flux values relative the other 4 stages.
    <bold>(c)</bold> Predicted sampled flux distribution are shown in the non-oxidative
    branch of PPP (Transketolase; TKT1) and inositol metabolism (myo-inositol-3-phosphate
    lyase; MI3PS) across all the stages showing increased involvement of inositol
    metabolism in the GV stage (see supplementary material for discussion and <xref

    while their deletion had no effect on the growth of human and non-human primate
    species. Differential essentiality of TPK is due to absence of phosphomethylpyrimidine
    kinase and thiamine-phosphate pyrophosphorylase the rodent-infecting species.
    In the case of CK, the differential essentiality is due to the absence of phosphoethanolamine
    N-methyltransferase. (See Table A in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005895.s002">S1
