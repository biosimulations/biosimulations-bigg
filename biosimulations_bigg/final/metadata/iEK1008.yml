    Workflow of reconstruction process. A draft GEM model was built from the TB BioCyc
    20.0 database and mapped to BIGGs IDs along with sMtb and iOSDD (see Additional
    file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>). The models were then unified
    by first joining the similarities between them, followed by manual curation of
    model differences literature and database validation. <bold>b</bold> Overlap of
    genes across different model sets. The model that covers most of the models within
    the particular set is enclosed by a box</p>
