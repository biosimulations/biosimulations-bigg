    chart showing the distribution of <italic>i</italic>JN746''s intracellular reactions
    over the different subsystems.</bold> The number of reactions per subsystem is
    shown and subsystems of high importance were highlighted in bold. <bold>B</bold>.
    Heat map of the confidence score of the different subsystems in <italic>i</italic>JN746.
    The 4 rows in the map represent the different confidence score (from left to right:
    4, 3, 2, 1). The various colors correspond to the percentage of subsystems reactions
    that have the corresponding confidence score (red = 100%, blue = 0%). The confidence
    level was based on a scale from 1 to 4. A level, or score, of 4 corresponds to
    biochemical evidence for a gene product and its reaction(s); 3 represents physiological,
    genetic, or proteomic evidence; 2 corresponds to only sequence-based evidence
    for a gene product and its reaction(s); and finally a score of 1 reflects that
    the reaction had to be included for model functionality (e. g., production of
    biomass precursor).</p>'

    the aromatic compound degradation routes present in <italic>i</italic>JN746.</bold>
    The protocatechuate (pca genes) and catechol (cat genes) branches of the beta-ketoadipate
    pathway are shown as well as peripheral pathways by orange arrows. The homogentisate
    pathway (hmg genes) is represented by green arrows and the phenylacetate pathway
    (paa genes) is represented by purple arrows. The nicotinate and gallate pathways
    (unknown genes) are shown by green and red arrows, respectively. Finally, the
    Tol pathway (xyl genes from pWW0 plasmid) for toluene and xylene degradation is
    represented by blue arrows. The initial aromatic compounds are indicated by green
    circles and the central metabolic compounds for each pathway are also highlighted.
    A detailed list of reactions involved in aromatic acid degradation can be found
    in the Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S9">9</xref>.</p>
