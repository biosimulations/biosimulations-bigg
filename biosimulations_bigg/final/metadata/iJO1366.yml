- caption: <p>Properties of <italic>i</italic>JO1366. (<bold>A</bold>) The number
    of reactions in each of 11 functional categories. Non-gene-associated (orphan)
    reactions are indicated by the lighter portion at the far right of each bar. (<bold>B</bold>)
    The number of genes with associated reactions in each category. The number of
    genes unique to each category (i.e. associated only with reactions in one category)
    is given as a percentage. (<bold>C</bold>) The number of unique metabolites that
    participate in at least one reaction in each category, with the number of metabolites
    unique to each category indicated. (<bold>D</bold>) Histogram of the years in
    which the function of each of the 107 new genes was first unambiguously identified.
    (<bold>E</bold>) Classification of each of the 107 new genes in <italic>i</italic>JO1366.
    &#8216;New content added' includes genes associated with new (non-gap-filling)
    pathways and systems in the model. &#8216;Orphan fill' includes genes associated
    with orphan reactions from <italic>i</italic>AF1260. &#8216;New gene with existing
    reaction' includes new isozymes for existing gene-associated reactions in <italic>i</italic>AF1260.
    &#8216;Gap fill' includes genes associated with new gap-filling reactions. &#8216;Others'
    includes genes that are associated both with new, non-gap-filling reactions, and
    with a previous orphan reaction or as a new isozyme.</p>

- caption: <p>Results of the mapping between the <italic>i</italic>JO1366 reconstruction
    and all 38 available <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>Shigella</italic> strains.
    (<bold>A</bold>) The number of strain models capable of producing all components
    of the <italic>i</italic>JO1366 core biomass reaction at different PID cutoffs.
    The PID of 40% used in parts (<bold>B</bold>, <bold>C</bold>) of this figure is
    indicated with a yellow square. At a PID of 40%, only four strains are incapable
    of complete biomass synthesis. (<bold>B</bold>) Biomass components that cannot
    be produced in one or more models with a PID of 40%. The strains are indicated
    by their KEGG organism code. (<bold>C</bold>) The fraction of <italic>i</italic>JO1366
    genes present in all 38 strains at a PID of 40%. Strains are listed by their KEGG
    organism code. Laboratory strains are colored blue, commensal and environmental
    strains are in green, and pathogens are in red. A dashed line indicates the average
    fraction of genes present (97%).</p>
