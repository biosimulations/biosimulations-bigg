- caption: <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Principles of constraint-based
    modeling. A three-dimensional flux space for a given metabolic network is depicted
    here. Without any constraints the fluxes can take on any real value. After application
    of stoichiometric, thermodynamic and enzyme capacity constraints, the possible
    solutions are confined to a region in the total flux space, termed the allowable
    solution space. Any point outside of this space violates one or more of the applied
    constraints. Linear optimization can then be applied to identify a solution in
    the allowable solution space that maximizes or minimizes a defined objective,
    for example ATP or biomass production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref

- caption: <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Representation of gene to
    protein to reaction (GPR) associations. Each gene included in the model is associated
    with at least one reaction. Examples of different types of associations are shown,
    where the top layer is the gene locus, the second layer is the translated peptide,
    the third layer is the functional protein and the bottom layer is the reaction
    (shown as its corresponding abbreviation listed in the additional data file).
    Subunits (for example, sdhABCD and gapC_1C_2) and enzyme complexes (for example,
    xylFGH) are connected to reactions with '&amp;' associations, indicating that
    all have to be expressed for the reaction to occur. For sdhABCD, the '&amp;' is
    shown above the functional protein level, denoting that all of these gene products
    are needed for the functional enzyme. With xylFGH the '&amp;' association is shown
    above the reaction level, indicating that the different proteins form a complex
    that carries out the reaction. Isozymes (for example, gapC_1C_2 and gapA) are
    independent proteins which carry out identical reactions where only one of the
    isozymes needs to be present for the reaction to occur. Isozymes are shown as
    two or more arrows leaving different proteins but impinging on the same reaction.</p>

- caption: <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Effect of proton balancing
    on predicted growth rate. The figure shows how limiting the exchange of protons
    between the cell and the medium affects the predicted growth rates under aerobic
    conditions. The relative growth rate (<italic>y</italic>-axis) is the ratio of
    the predicted growth rate when the proton exchange flux is limited over the predicted
    growth rate when the proton exchange flux is not limited (at its optimal value).
    These calculations are for the conditions of aerobic growth on minimal media;
    the carbon source uptake rates were set to 5 mmol/g DW-hr and the maximum oxygen
    uptake rate was set to 20 mmol/g DW-hr. Carbon sources resulting in an outward
    flux of protons (lines to the right of the <italic>y</italic>-axis) would make
    the medium more acidic, while carbon sources resulting in an inward flux of protons
    (lines to the left of the <italic>y</italic>-axis) would make the medium more
    basic.</p>

- caption: '<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Flux map of TCA cycle and
    citrate lyase. During oxygen-limited growth on &#945;KG maximal biomass will be
    made by utilizing the citrate lyase reaction. As oxygen becomes more limiting,
    the reactions shown in red, culminating in the production of oxaloacetate (OAA),
    were predicted by <italic>i</italic>JR904 to be used more heavily than the forward
    direction of the TCA cycle reactions (shown in black). <italic>i</italic>JE660a
    does not include the citrate lyase reaction so carbon flow is directed only in
    the forward direction of the TCA cycle; these reactions produce more reduced redox
    carriers, which are difficult for the cell to oxidize in an oxygen-limited environment.
    The ''+'' sign indicates that the cofactor is produced by the reaction in the
    direction shown and the ''-'' sign indicates that the cofactor is consumed. For
    abbreviations see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, with the following
