    the integration of exometabolomic (EM) data with the constraint-based framework</bold>.
    (A) Cells are subjected to genetic and/or environmental perturbations to secrete
    metabolite patterns unique to that condition. (B) EM is detected, identified,
    and quantified. (C) EM data is integrated as required secretion flux constraints
    to define allowable solution space. (D) Random sampling of solution space yields
    the range of feasible flux distributions for intracellular reactions. (E) Sampled
    fluxes were compared to sampled fluxes of another condition to determine which
    metabolic regions were altered between the two conditions (see Figure 2). (F)
    Significantly altered metabolic regions were identified.</p>

- caption: <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><bold>Schematic of sampling
    and scoring analysis to determine intracellular flux changes</bold>. (A) Reaction
    fluxes are sampled for two conditions. (B &amp; C) Sample of flux differences
    is calculated by selecting random flux values from each condition to obtain a
    distribution of flux differences for each reaction. (D) Standardized reaction
    <italic>Z</italic>-scores are determined, which represent how far the sampled
    flux differences deviates from a zero flux change. Reaction scores can be used
    in visualizing perturbation subnetworks and analyzing reporter metabolites and
    subsystems.</p>

    subnetwork of <italic>gdh1/GDH2 </italic>mutant under aerobic conditions</bold>.
    The network illustrates a simplified subset of highly perturbed reactions connected
    to aerobically-secreted metabolites predicted from the sampling analysis of the
    <italic>gdh1/GDH2 </italic>mutant strain. The major secreted metabolites (glutamate,
    proline, D-lactate, and 2-hydroxybuturate) were also detected in the anaerobic
    condition. Metabolite abbreviations are found in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material"

- caption: <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><bold>Perturbation reaction
    subnetwork of <italic>gdh1/GDH2 </italic>mutant under anaerobic conditions</bold>.
    Subnetwork illustrates the highly perturbed anaerobic reactions of similar <italic>Z</italic><sub>reaction
    </sub>magnitude to the reactions in Figure 3. A significantly larger number of
    reactions indicates mutant metabolic effects are more widespread in the anaerobic
    environment. The network shows that perturbed pathways converge on glutamate,
    the main site in which the <italic>gdh1/GDH2 </italic>modification was introduced,
    which suggests that the direct genetic perturbation effects are amplified under
    this environment. Metabolite abbreviations are found in Additional file <xref

    reporter metabolites (i.e. in yellow) in ammonium-toxic and potassium-limited
    conditions</bold>. Amino acid perturbation patterns (shown in red) were shown
    to be consistently scored across conditions, indicating that potassium-limited
    environments K1 (lowest concentration) and K2 (low concentration) elicited a similar
    ammonium detoxification response as ammonium-toxic environments N1 (high concentration)
    and N2 (highest concentration). Metabolites associated with folate metabolism
    (highlighted in green) are also highly perturbed in ammonium-toxic conditions.
