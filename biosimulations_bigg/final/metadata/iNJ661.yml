- caption: <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The Gene Index for Mycobacterium
    tuberculosis H37Rv was downloaded from The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR)
    [45]. Reconstruction content was defined based on the sequence annotation, legacy
    data, the Tuberculist database [31], ancillary sources such as the Kyoto Encyclopedia
    of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), and SEED [47]. Reactions were defined and according
    to the Tuberculist web and KEGG. Legacy data was also used in the process of building
    the model from the reconstruction. The manual curation aspects of the reconstruction
    are outlined above and discussed in further detail in [42]. Debugging was started
    once the first draft of the reconstruction was completed and functional testing
    (i.e. flux balance analysis calculations, etc.) were begun.</p>

    iNJ661 can grow with glycerol serving as the sole carbon source, but not glucose.
    The open dots are the calculated phase points and the solid black lines indicate
    isoclines. b. Phase plane diagram for phosphate versus sulfate uptake on Middlebrook

    the organism to be able to grow.</p>
