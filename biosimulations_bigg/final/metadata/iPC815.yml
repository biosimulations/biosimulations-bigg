    In the latter case, an E.C. number associated with more than one reaction was
    only counted once. The low overlap between iPC815 and the <italic>Y. pestis </italic>91001
    reconstruction arises from the use of E.C. numbers to compare the two models rather
    than true biological differences between the two strains.</p>'

    The last step during each fatty acid elongation cycle involves the reduction of
    an enoyl-ACP intermediate. In other Enterobacteria such as <italic>E. coli </italic>and
    <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium, FabI catalyzes this step; however, the current
    annotation of the YP CO92 genome does not contain <italic>fabI</italic>. <bold>B</bold>.
    The enzyme ArgD catalyzes the sixth step in the nine-step lysine biosynthesis
    pathway, but <italic>argD </italic>(YPO0170) is disrupted in YP CO92. YPO1962
    has the greatest homology to YPO0170 within the <italic>Y. pestis </italic>CO92
    genome, and we hypothesize here that YPO1962 can replace the function of YPO0170.
    Note: although each reaction in each pathway is depicted as unidirectional, some
    are reversible.</p>'
