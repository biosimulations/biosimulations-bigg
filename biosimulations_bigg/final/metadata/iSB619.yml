- caption: <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><bold>Amino acid contributions
    to growth. </bold>The results of adding equivalent quantities of each amino acid
    to the media are shown here. Red bars represent amino acids that are reported
    essential in the literature, and green bars are amino acids that are not. Arginine
    is present in all cases and is the baseline against which the rest of the values
    are normalized. On average, adding an essential amino acid to the media allows
    better growth than does adding a non-essential amino acid. E stands for average
    essential amino acid, and NE stands for average non-essential amino acid. Two
    amino acids do not have transporters in the genome annotation and are not included
    here for that reason.</p>

    with different carbon sources. </bold>The in silico growth of <italic>i</italic>SB619
    varies depending on which carbon source is provided and the amount of oxygen present.
    The predicted efficiency of carbon incorporation into biomass is shown here as
    a function on the oxygen consumption. Growth rate is normalized relative to the
    number of carbon atoms per molecule. Oxygen consumption is normalized relative
    to optimal oxygen consumption for each carbon source. Trehalose, lactose, and
    sucrose all overlap (the trehalose line indicates all three). The legend is presented
    in the same order as the carbon sources appear in the figure, top to bottom.</p>
