    We compared the gene content in <italic>i</italic>YS854 to that of the four previous
    GEMs of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> and categorized them by their
    metabolic sub-modules. For purposes of clarity we only show a subset of the sub-modules
    across three COG categories: cofactor and prosthetic group metabolism, transport,
    and cell wall metabolism. The color scale represents the percentage of novel genes
    in <italic>i</italic>YS864 with respect to previous GEMs (columns) by each metabolic
    sub-module (rows). We highlight the date for the most recent reference that was
    added in <italic>i</italic>YS854 for each metabolic sub-module (see S3 Table in
    <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006644.s002">S2 Appendix</xref>
    for more details). Genes may have different annotations in previous reconstructions
    (for example the staphylopine biosynthesis pathway was only uncovered in 2016).
    Note that &#8220;h&#8221; represents a metabolic sub-module that was added based
    on gene homology. (B) We compared the most recently published GEM with <italic>i</italic>YS854
    and highlighted the new additions in reaction content per COG module.</p>'

    measurements (for both CDM and CDMG) were used to build two condition specific

    experimentally observed growth rates. See <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material"

    intracellular ATP concentration between the two condition-specific GEMs <bold>(Methods)</bold>.
    (C) Growth phenotype predictions for 28 CDM-specific mutant GEMs were compared
    against experimentally observed transposon mutant growth phenotypes. Two genes
    (<italic>ackA</italic> and <italic>gudB</italic>) were classified as false positives
    due to the presence of alternative pathways. (D) We simulated single reaction
    knockouts and compared essential reactions across conditions. The Venn diagram
    highlights the differences in reaction essentiality between the CDM-specific GEM
    and the CDMG-specific GEM.</p>

    to significantly differ in their flux distribution (determined by the Kolmogorov-Smirnoff
    test) between the CDMG- and CDM-specific GEM are shown. The width of the arrows
    qualitatively represents the median flux value across 10,000 sampled fluxes. The
    blue arrows represent the flux simulation results for the CDM-specific GEM and
    the red arrows represent the flux simulations of the CDMG-specific GEM. The13C
    labelled intracellular metabolites detected by NMR in both conditions are highlighted
    in red (metabolic intermediates derived from extracellular glucose in CDMG) and
    in blue (metabolic intermediates derived from nine extracellular amino acids in
    CDM) [<xref rid="pcbi.1006644.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. Metabolites
    highlighted in grey are present in the extracellular medium (note that D-glucose
    is only present in CDMG). (B) Differential cycling of ammonium (as well as several
    cofactors) between the two GEMs highlights the relative contribution to the production
    and consumption of ammonium for all reactions utilizing or synthesizing ammonium
    in CDM (blue) and CDMG (red). Several metabolic processes contribute to the ammonium
    pool in CDM (including the glycine cleavage system) while serine dehydrogenase
    is the main source of ammonium in CDMG.</p>
