Here we present Recon3D, a computational resource that includes three-dimensional (3D) metabolite and protein structure data and enables integrated analyses of metabolic functions in humans. We use Recon3D to functionally characterize mutations associated with disease, and identify metabolic response signatures that are caused by exposure to certain drugs. Recon3D represents the most comprehensive human metabolic network model to date, accounting for 3,288 open reading frames (representing 17% of functionally annotated human genes), 13,543 metabolic reactions involving 4,140 unique metabolites, and 12,890 protein structures. These data provide a unique resource for investigating molecular mechanisms of human metabolism.

A genome-scale network reconstruction represents a curated knowledge-base containing many different data types and sources, including high-quality genome annotation, assessment of biochemical properties of gene products, and a wide array of physiological functional information. Computational genome-scale models integrate large-scale omics data from these knowledge-bases to aid in the interpretation and prediction of biological functions<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. In recent years, human metabolic network reconstructions<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> have generated insights into inborn errors of metabolism<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>, cancer<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> and human microbiome co-metabolism<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">Using metabolic reconstructions, information about chemical reactions is stored and continually updated in a standardized biochemical and genetic representation through a well-established process<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. Over the past ten years, updating the human metabolic network reconstruction has focused on expansion of metabolic reaction coverage. From the first human reconstruction, Recon1<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>, to the most recent version, Recon2<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>, the content has been expanded from 1,496 genes (corresponding to 3,311 reactions) to 1,675 genes (7,785 reactions). Various other reconstructions have been released and community driven-efforts have been made to ensure interoperability of these resources<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. Our knowledge about human metabolism is continuously increasing and the deluge of &#x02018;omics&#x02019; data provides ample opportunity for updating current knowledge-bases of human metabolism<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. In addition to updating metabolic coverage, expanding human reconstructions to include different types, such as metabolite and protein structures as well as atom- transitions, thereby enables a broader scope of biomedical questions to be addressed.</p><p id="P5">Historically, systems biology has focused on characterizing catalytic or regulatory roles of proteins in metabolism without placing emphasis on the three-dimensional structure of the proteins themselves. For example, studies on genetic variation have mainly focused on frequency of occurrence<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> or sequence-based attributes<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. Only recently have mutations been explored in the context of their three-dimensional location or spatial relationship<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. Exploring mutations in 3D extends beyond nucleotide sequence identity<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>, as mutations that may be far away from each other in linear sequence may actually be proximal in the folded state. In recent years, increasingly accessible protein and metabolite data have enabled the progression of systems biology to a 3D perspective. In one study, protein structures were mapped to the metabolic network of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, to reveal the role of ribosome pausing in co-translational protein folding<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. In another study, human population variation was studied by integrating protein structures with the human erythrocyte metabolic network to understand the adverse effects of drugs on genetic variants<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> and identify new pathways related to drug perturbation. These studies highlight the value of integrating different types of data to address complex biological questions.</p><p id="P6">We present Recon3D, an updated and expanded human metabolic network reconstruction that integrates pharmacogenomic associations, large-scale phenotypic data, and structural information for both proteins and metabolites. Recon3D contains over 6,000 more reactions than Recon2, all of which were manually curated to remove redundant or blocked reactions. We use Recon3D to prioritize putative disease-causing genetic variants by mapping single nucleotide variants (SNVs) to protein structures. We show that deleterious mutations are more likely to cluster together into functional hotspots than non-deleterious mutations. In contrast to previous models, these mutation hotspots identify ACAT1 as a cancer-related gene. Furthermore, we demonstrate how structural information can be used to investigate the potential mechanisms by which drugs exert an effect on metabolism. The Recon3D Resource (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://vmh.life">http://vmh.life</ext-link>) provides new avenues for investigating the molecular basis of disease and may aid the development of treatment strategies, biomarkers, and drug repurposing.</p><sec sec-type="results" id="S1"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="S2"><title>Increasing the scope of the human metabolic network reconstruction</title><p id="P7">We expanded Recon 2<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> by using ten metabolomic data sets to identify new metabolites and transport and catalyzing reactions (1,865 reactions).

Overall, 66 metabolic subsystems, including lipoprotein (44 reactions) and bile acid (216 reactions), were expanded and 10 new subsystems were added (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Figure 1&#x02013;3</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Data Files 1&#x02013;2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Note 1</xref>). We further refined numerous aspects of the reconstruction, including 2,181 gene-protein-reaction (&#x02018;GPR&#x02019;) associations, reaction/metabolite duplication, reaction directionality, and thermodynamic feasibility (see Online Methods). The metabolic scope was extended by 82% (total 13,543) reactions and 58% (total 4,140) unique metabolites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1(a-b)</xref>). Recon3D is the most comprehensive metabolic resource currently available (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 1(a-c)</xref>). Out of the 20,266 human proteins documented in UniProt<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> (queried July 2016), 19,213 are functionally annotated (i.e., not hypothetical) and 17% of this subset is metabolic, well-characterized, and included in Recon3D.</p><p id="P8">Genome-scale network reconstructions can be converted into computational models that enable predictive biology<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>.

In addition, we mapped content from a variety of external database resources (Online Methods), to include metabolite structures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Data File 14</xref>). We obtained high-quality structural coverage for over 80% of the human metabolic proteome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2(a)</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Figure 6</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Tables 2&#x02013;4</xref>) and 85% of the metabolome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2(b)</xref>). Furthermore, we used 2,369 unique metabolite structures to trace algorithmically atom transitions<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> (from each substrate to product atom) for 7,804 (87%) internal, mass-balanced reactions of the Recon 3D derived model (Online Methods; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Note 3</xref>) . The prediction accuracy of the algorithms was validated by comparison with 512 manually curated atom mapped reactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2(c)</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Figure 7</xref>). The atom mappings enable identification of conserved moieties, which are the fundamental structural units of any chemical reaction network. Hence, we provide an invaluable bridge between metabolic modeling and chemoinformatics. For the first time, relationships between human metabolic genes, their encoded proteins, and the reactions they catalyze can be described in the context of specific 3D configurations, interactions, and properties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1(c-d)</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Web visualization of protein structures in metabolic networks</title><p id="P10">Using Recon3D, we have implemented the first web-based visualization of 3D macromolecular structures in the context of their neighboring chemical reactions, metabolites, and their metabolic subsystems, (e.g., glycolysis, citric acid cycle, amino acid metabolism, and carbohydrate metabolism, among others).

Such domains (e.g., tim-barrel motif) are often linked directly to their encoding gene&#x02019;s function, and thus provide a new way to directly assess the functional impact of a mutation.</p><p id="P12">We used Recon3D to map missense mutations from Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) database (dbSNP)<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>, UniProt<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>, PharmGKB<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>, among others, to the metabolic network using a previously established pipeline<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3(a)</xref>). We chose to focus on SNPs that were known to be deleterious or potentially harmful. In total, we mapped 3,536 SNPs to 655 genes within Recon3D. We identified representative protein domains for this set of genes using a structure-based clustering algorithm<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>. We tallied the number of SNPs (or single nucleotide variants, SNVs) occurring in each protein domain and found the gene to domain ratio to be less than one (i.e., domain redundancy; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Figure 12(a)</xref>). This analysis resulted in the identification of specific regions within protein domains that are commonly mutated (mutation hotspots), share common disease associations, and are prone to malfunction. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3(b)</xref>, six genes share the Bruton&#x02019;s Tyrosine Kinase representative domain (PDP:4RFZa, PF007714) and, when mutated, are affiliated with diseases such as cancer. This kinase domain is known for its role in non-small cell lung cancer<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> and the SNPs associated with lung cancer cluster in one specific region of the protein (see the red-colored mutation hotspot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3(b)</xref>).</p><p id="P13">The power of exploring gene variation in the context of <italic>both</italic> protein and network structure is further illustrated by Aryl sulfatase A (ARSA). Within the subset of SNPs that map to the representative domain of ARSA (SCOP: d1e2sp_), the mutation P428L (P426L in PDB 1e2s; dbSNP rs28940893) is associated with Metachromatic Leukodystrophy Disease (MLD)<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup>.

Other SNPs associated with the most severe form of MLD are located in the vicinity of the metal binding site, a mutation hotspot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4(c)</xref>).

We studied 889 somatic cancer mutations from 88 genes (which were previously analyzed<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup>) from whole-exome sequence data from 178 tumour&#x02013;normal pairs of lung squamous cell carcinoma<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup>.

Using Recon3D, we mapped each of the mutations to their corresponding protein, its representative domain(s) and network reaction(s) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5(a)</xref>).</p><p id="P15">Analysis of all cancer mutations in the context of their representative protein domains suggests that oncogenic mutations cluster in structurally-equivalent positions within representative domains. For the 88 genes, we counted the number of mutations that occur within 5 &#x000c5; of another mutation within the representative domain (referred to as the 3D hotspot analysis; Online Methods; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Note 5</xref>). In some cases, mutations from different genes co-occurred in the same region of a shared domain, suggesting that domain plays an important role in oncogenesis. Mutations co-occurring in the same location of other mutations are significantly more likely to be associated with somatic mutations, when compared to a random selection (p &#x0003c; 0.02 using a two-tailed t-test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5(b)</xref>). All data mapping related to the somatic cancer mutations can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Data Files 21&#x02013;23</xref>).</p><p id="P16">Filtering mutations based on their spatial relationships brings about several significant biomedical implications. When mutations are rank-ordered by the number of neighboring mutations, we can filter the mutations with known roles in oncogenesis (based on known annotations<sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5(c)</xref>). For example, we find that selecting the top 25% of the data recovers 82 and 88 percent based on co-occurrence aids in identifying known oncogenic mutations and GOF mutations, respectively (compared to 1.6 and 2.9 percent when selected at random; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5(c)</xref>; for a sensitivity analysis, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Note 5</xref>). Furthermore, striking similarities in protein structure, based on three-dimensional structure alignments, indicate that not only do mutations co-occur in shared domains, they also occur in structurally-similar proteins within the same dataset (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Figure 12(b)</xref>). These findings suggest that cancer mutations cluster in functionally-relevant parts of protein domains and that this property could guide the discovery of novel biomarkers and drug targets.</p><p id="P17">We combined our approach with metabolic modeling to understand whether structural information could improve the predictive power of the model. We focused on glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), a malignant brain tumour, and studied the mutational landscape of metabolic genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5(a)</xref>). Genes were selected based on the rate of mutation found in exome samples of 291 glioblastomas as well as involvement in cholesterol metabolism<sup><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> (Online Methods; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Note 5</xref>). Gene knockdowns were performed and the essential genes were compared across different generic and cell-type specific human metabolic models (Recon3D, HMR2, and HMR-derived TCGA-derived models<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> (Online Methods). Notably, the majority of models predicted the gene ACAT1 (GeneID 38) to be non-essential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5 (d)</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Figure 13</xref>).

Displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6(c)</xref> is one connected hub of genes (antipsychotic gene indication signature) and several features for comparison: protein structural domains, metabolites, biochemical reactions, and disease relevance. For this signature, we found several overlapping features, such as the metabolic subsystems targeted by known drugs (e.g., lovastatin and fatty acid metabolism) and the function of certain protein domains (e.g., an influence in membrane binding/trafficking). Despite these shared domain functions, minimal structural alignment of the protein domains and metabolites indicates that the majority of genes in this signature are not direct drug targets, but may play a role in compensatory signalling pathways that mediate drug effects synergistically. Finally, structural alignment of the drug compounds themselves yielded unexpected results; drugs that induced the same pattern of perturbation (both drugs with known antipsychotic action and unrelated drug indications) were found to be structurally diverse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6(d)</xref>).

We performed a sensitivity analysis to understand whether the selection of data points had an effect on the significance of these results.</p><p id="P41">The above 3D hotspot analysis approach was also applied to 22 genes from which cancer mutations have already been analyzed<sup><xref rid="R65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref></sup> (exome samples of 291 glioblastomas) and 92 genes involved in cholesterol metabolism, owing to the fact that cholesterol biosynthesis plays an important role in GBM<sup><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup>.</p><sec id="S17"><title>Statistical Tests</title><p id="P42">We performed a sensitivity analysis to understand whether the selection of data points had an effect on the significance of these results. We find that the 3D hotspot analysis is more likely to select somatic mutations compared to a random selection. Data points (50&#x02013;700) were selected so that 0.065&#x02013;0.91 of the total data set was covered. We performed the 3D hotpot analysis across the different selections and found p values to range 0.017 - 0.049 compared to 0.182&#x02013;0.241, using a random residue selection.</p><p id="P43">For annotations of mutations that are known oncogenes (KO) and known hotspots (HS), selection of the data based on 3D hotspot analysis is significant, regardless the number of data (or % of data) selected (pval &#x0003c; 0.05). Compared to a random selection, our computed (using a two-tailed t-test) p value is &#x0003e; 0.1. We also performed a sensitivity analysis using the slices of the total data set as mentioned above (50&#x02013;500 data points) and computed the total number of known oncogenes and known hotspots (from previously published analyses), using the 3D hotspot analysis compared to a random selection. We find that the percentage of data selected is significantly higher using the 3D hotspot analysis. For KO, 37&#x02013;83% of the data is selected using 3D hotspot compared to 0.046&#x02013;0.43 at random. Similarly, for HS, 72.5&#x02013;88.3% of the data is selected using 3D hotspot analysis compared to 9.8&#x02013;64%.

An example is the alpha/beta protein domain (d1su0a_), which is present in eight different genes (described by Uniprot accession number). The proteins encoded by these genes belong to the reductase family; they catalyze different reactions in various metabolic subsystems, ranging from glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway to xenobiotics metabolism and glycerophospholipid metabolism.

Information was cross-referenced from Recon3D to human variation and pharmacogenomics databases, such as dbSNP<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>, PharmGKB<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>, and cancer-specific databases, such as the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), the Human Protein Atlas (HPA), and CMap. We mapped single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to the genes in Recon3D. Within the set of genes with genetic variation, we focused on cases where (1) protein structural data was available; (2) SNPs/SNVs were considered to be deleterious or potentially harmful (655 genes). <bold>(b)</bold> Using this information, we probed characteristics of missense mutations and their three-dimensional spatial relationships. For each protein, we identified its representative protein structural domain (or a fold or set of folds unique to a given protein or multiple proteins). For example, for kinases, we identify various representative domains (five are shown here) that are associated with one or multiple genes (given by UniProt accession numbers). To this end, these five representative domains constitute &#x0201c;structure-based protein templates&#x0201d; shared among a group of genes. As illustrated, numerous mutations are found in 3D localized &#x0201c;hotspots&#x0201d; (or regions of the domain that experience high mutation burden). Interestingly, these mutation hotspots appear to be associated with specific diseases, such as primary brain cancer, glioblastoma, and other cancers in the case of Bruton&#x02019;s Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) kinase domain scaffold (PDP:4RFZAa). All domains are determined by structural alignment<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> and those featured here are named by the Protein Domain Parser (PDP) and the corresponding PDB structure (and chain) selected as the representative domain (see Online Methods; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Note 3</xref>). Colors map genes to the region (hotspot) of their respective variant(s) and the diseases associated with that variant.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="nihms934074f3"/></fig><fig id="F4" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>An example of bridging systems biology and structural biology through Recon3D</title><p id="P64"><bold>(a)</bold> Arylsulfatase A (ARSA) highlights an example of how the intersection of systems, structural, and pharmacogenomic information provides additional understanding of human disease variants. The macromolecular assembly in the native state contains a homo-octamer (four complexes of homodimers; PDB entry 1auk). <bold>(b)</bold> Identifying the location of a variant (e.g., P426L, dbSNP rs28940893) within the protein three-dimensional structure reveals mechanistic details of disease progression. This mutation, which is associated with a mild form of Metachromatic Leukodystrophy (MLD), weakens the interaction between monomers, causing the biological assembly to favor the homo-dimer state over the homo-octamer state. <bold>(c)</bold> Clustering all SNPs that fall within a 5&#x02013;10&#x000c5; vicinity of other mutations, we find that the largest cluster falls within 10 &#x000c5; of both the metal-binding site and the substrate-binding site (residues 306 to 309 in PDB entry e2sp). These specific cases all cause a severe form of MLD in adults, juveniles, and infants. The distribution of structural and disease properties associated with all 76 SNPs that map to the representative domain of this protein (d1e2sp_) is given by the bar chart. The majority of cases map to the calcium binding domain, substrate binding domain, and have a significant effect on enzyme activity. <bold>(d)</bold> ARSA and its neighborhood of surrounding reactions link to a number of disease-associated mutations, indicating that this is a &#x0201c;network hotspot&#x0201d; for deleterious or potentially harmful mutations. In many cases, the proteins catalyzing these reactions also have available protein structural content (shown by a heat map and reaction link color), enabling 3D visualization of other SNPs in proteins in neighboring reactions.

Reactions are drawn with minimal number of metabolites and cofactors for clarity.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="nihms934074f4"/></fig><fig id="F5" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Protein structure-guided discovery of mutation hotspots across structurally-related genes</title><p id="P65">Synchronization of protein structural domains, metabolic networks, and somatic mutation landscapes allows for stratification of variants into informative and meaningful sub-clusters. <bold>(a)</bold> The 3D hotspot analysis workflow. A list of genes with mutations<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> is cross-referenced with databases such as TCGA. In this example, we studied mutations taken from whole-exome sequence data from 178 tumour&#x02013;normal pairs of lung squamous cell carcinoma<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup>. We then assembled protein structural information for this subset of genes with somatic mutations and evaluated the number of representative protein domains for this set of genes. In total, 86 genes associated with 889 missense mutations had available experimental crystallographic structures and could be linked to representative structural domains. We tallied the mutations occurring within 5 and 10 &#x000c5; spheres for each representative domain. The domains with multiple mutations in a specific 3D location were termed &#x0201c;mutation hotspots.&#x0201d; <bold>(b)</bold> We compared the frequency of mutation co-occurrence (in a 5 &#x000c5; sphere) in randomly selected residues (grey) within the same set of proteins with those taken from the lung cancer dataset (black). This comparison strongly suggests that somatic mutations are more likely to be found neighboring other mutations than what is expected by chance (<italic>p</italic>, val &#x0003c; 0.02). <bold>(c)</bold> Selecting the top 25% of mutations (235/889) with the highest number of neighboring mutations (within the same 5&#x000c5; region in a representative protein domain) brings about a striking commonality that many are associated with known oncogenic roles. Information about various mutations was taken from several databases providing detailed annotations (which are color-coded in the plot), including recurrent sequence hotspots (R)<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>, known oncogenes (KO)<sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.oncokb.org">www.oncokb.org</ext-link>), as well as drug (Olaparib/BYL-719), Memorial Sloan Kettering level of evidence (3B), and other cancer subtype (endometrial/breast) associations (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mycancergenome.org">www.mycancergenome.org</ext-link>). For example, of all the mutations in this dataset with gain-of-function (GOF) oncogenic associations, 83% are found in the subset of mutations selected for on the basis of 3D localization. Similarly high percentages are recovered for other characteristic annotations, including the frequency of occurrence (88%), association with endometrial cancer (100%), and associated with breast cancer (40%). Intriguingly, percentage of mutations with unknown effects is greatly reduced from 90% in the total dataset (bottom pie chart; 889 mutations across 86 genes) compared to 10% in the 3D filtered subset (top pie chart; 235 mutations across 26 genes). Random selection of 235 mutations (averaged across 10,000 trials) demonstrates that the probability of recovering the same percentage of mutations with known oncogenic roles is very low (shown by the white outlined bars). <bold>(d)</bold> We combined the 3D hotspot analysis with metabolic modeling and focused on the somatic landscape of glioblastoma multiforme<sup><xref rid="R65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref></sup>. Gene knockdowns were performed in various models, including Recon3D, HMR2.0, and cell-specific (GBM) and patient-specific models. <bold>(e)</bold> The majority of models predicted ACAT1 to be non-essential. Yet, when analyzing the mutations in this gene in 3D, we find a mutation hotspot. The importance of this gene is further confirmed by experiment, demonstrating its importance to GBM growth<sup><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup>.

A total of 47 drug indications were analyzed in the context of the metabolic network, based upon 1,459 expression sets from cell culture responses to 334 drugs (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Data File 26</xref>). <bold>(b)</bold> Cross validation results of metabolic gene expression signatures trained against drug indications versus the number of expression sets with the indication used in training. Results were empirically grouped as highly predictive, predictive, and marginally or poorly predictive based on AUC. Results were plotted with consideration to dataset size, showing that the signature is conserved over a greater number of drugs and amount of noise. Schizophrenia appeared as a clear outlier with greater predictability for a relatively large number of expression sets and drugs (13 drugs used in training), indicating that the gene signature is highly conserved (median AUC of 0.8). <bold>(c)</bold> Analysis of the antipsychotic signature in the context of known metabolic effects in schizophrenia and antipsychotic therapy. Genes that cluster based on the antipsychotic drug indication signature are linked to structure, biochemical, and disease properties through Recon3D.

Computing structural alignments of the drugs inducing the antipsychotic drug indication signature indicates that certain pairs are likely to have similar bioactivities (based on tanimoto coefficient &#x0003e; 0.8). Chemically similar drugs cluster into four structurally distinct groups that differ on the basis of drug class. Drugs within these four groups all induce the same drug indication signature despite being radically different in structure (tanimoto coefficient &#x0003c; 0.2).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="nihms934074f6"/></fig></floats-group></article>
